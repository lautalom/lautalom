My name is Lautaro (Lau for short), and I spend time here mostly (though not only) for college work. I am currently pursuing a CS degree at National University of Cordoba, Argentina. You may find my college as FaMAF. Sometimes I would just fork or share something completely for fun. Want to chat? Feel free to email me.
